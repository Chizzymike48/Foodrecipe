    These ribs are moist, juicy, and tender. They are slowly cooked at a low temperature <br>
    to make a perfect hit. They are smoky, sweet, savory, and full of flavor.

    <h2>Easy Grilled Beef Back Ribs Recipe</h2>
    <p>Summer is never complete without seasoned BBQ beef ribs coated <br>
    with juicy BBQ sauce. BBQ Ribs are delicious beef ribs with dry <br>
    rub-mix matched with sweet sauce. These are perfect for your next <br> 
    game day, casual dinner, or family party however, they can be tough <br>
    to make. Here's a simple recipe for grilled beef ribs that you can try out at home.</p>
    <p>I used an outdoor charcoal grill for that smoky taste. However, <br>
     if you don't have an outdoor grill, no problem. I have added an <br>
     option for the oven method in the recipe box below. </p>
     <p>I also used beef back ribs, but you can use the short ribs <br>
     or side ribs which are meatier if that is what is available to you.</p> <br>
     <h2>Slow-cooked beef ribs</h2>
     <p>They are savory and sweet, slowly roasted and brushed with <br>
     bbq sauce, and best paired with coleslaw or served over a bed <br>
     of your favorite fried rice. </p>
     <p>It's important to slowly cook the ribs over the grill because</p>
     <p>
    Beef ribs need to be cooked slowly at a low temperature <br>
    so that they have time to develop their flavors and get <br>
    tender and juicy. The grill does a great job of accomplishing <br>
    all this for you. You've got the nice texture and flavor of <br>
    ribs as well as the mouth-watering smell. It's barbecuing at <br>
    its finest! But what makes this recipe so special? It is the <br>
    slow cooking on the grill! It helps to:
     </p>
     <p>Concentrate the flavors of the meat so much more than anything else</p>
     <p>Maintain that yummy pink color on the meat.</p>
     <p>Give that perfect caramelized char.</p>
     <p>
    For making this recipe, you can make your own rub or use the store-bought ones. I like <br>
    making mine because I can control the amount of each ingredient, especially the salt.

        <h2>Barbeque Beef Ribs Rub</h2>
     <img src="https://www.thegeneticchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SlowCookedBBQBeefRibs-14.jpg" alt="">
     <p>The rub is a mixture of brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, <br>
     cumin powder, salt, and black pepper. You can make excess and keep the <br>
     remaining for your next cooking.
     </p>
     <p>The BBQ beef ribs aren't complete without this sauce. It is the crown over the beef. <br>
     You can add as much sauce as you desire and enjoy!</p>
     <h2>Ingredients for making BBQ Beef Ribs</h2>
     <p>Beef ribs -  You can get your beef ribs at a local grocery or meat store. <br>
     For this recipe, I use full slab back ribs.</p>
     <p>Brown sugar - You need brown sugar to make the rub mix and the BBQ sauce.</p>
     <p>Paprika - Add paprika to the rub mix to get that smoky flavor.</p>
     <p>Garlic, Onion, and Cumin powder - you need this in the seasoning <br>
       mix to make the ribs tasty and delicious.</p>
       <p>Salt - Add salt to taste</p>
       <p>Apple cider vinegar acts as an acid to help the meat tenderize. <br>
        You can also use lemon if you don't have apple cider vinegar.</p>
        <p>Liquid smoke - This is optional, but you can use it, especially <br>
         if you are not using the charcoal grill.</p>
         <p>Other ingredients for the BBQ sauce include Ketchup, Black pepper, <br>
         yellow mustard powder, Cayenne pepper, and Apple juice or water.</p>

         <p>To make the best Beef Ribs, I recommend slow cooking at a low temperature. This will help <br>
         soften the connective tissue that binds the muscle fibers in the meat, which will, in turn, <br>
          help the meat to fall apart more easily.</p>
          <center>Follow these easy steps to make perfect BBQ Beef ribs.</center>
          <p>Peel the membrane and trim any excess fat: Place the ribs on a wide tray or a <br>
        wooden slab, pull off the membrane, and remove any excess fat. If using short ribs, you <br>
        can leave out the membrane. Pulling off the membrane will help the meat fall apart easily.</p>
        <p>Mix the dry rub seasoning. Mix all the rub ingredients (brown sugar, paprika, <br>
        garlic powder, onion powder, cumin powder, salt, and black pepper) in a small bowl. <br>
        Season the ribs generously with the rub mix by pressing the rub firmly onto the ribs. <br>
         Cover up with foil while you prepare the barbeque sauce.</p>
         <p>Prepare your BBQ Sauce. Mix all the barbeque sauce ingredients and brush generously <br>
         over the front and back of the ribs. Leave to marinate for at least 3 hours in the <br>
        refrigerator. The time can be shorter but 3 hours is good if you have the time.</p>
        <p>Grill or Bake the BBQ Beef Ribs. </p>
        <p>Serve warm. Yummy!!</p>

        <h2>Grilling BBQ Beef Ribs</h2>
        <img src="https://cheflolaskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/DSC_1407-Bbq-Beef-Ribs.jpg.webp" alt="">
        <p>Start by preheating your grill at 250°F.</p>
        <p>Place the meatier side of the ribs down on the grill over indirect heat.</p>
        <p>Cook for about 2 hours, turning every 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>Baste with barbecue sauce (pour the BBQ sauce over the meat) in the last <br>
         10-20 minutes.</p>
         <p>Serve it warm and enjoy.</p> <br>
         <h2>Oven-Baked Beef Ribs</h2>
         <p>If baking is convenient, preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C).</p>
         <p>Place the ribs on a tray and cover the tray with another foil</p>
         <p>Bake in the oven covered for 2 hours. The foil prevents the beef from drying out.</p>
         <p>Remove the foil and bake for another hour or until the ribs reach an internal <br>
        temperature of 200°F. You can put additional sauce during the last open baking. <br> 
        This isn't necessary.</p>
        <p>Cook for an additional 30 minutes if you want ''fall off the bone'' ribs.</p>
        <p>Serve and enjoy</p> <br>
        <h2>What Kind of Beef Ribs should you buy?</h2>
        <p>We have the full slab back ribs and the short beef ribs. I like the full slab ribs <br>
         for this recipe because it works well with my dry rub seasoning and BBQ sauce. <br>
         You can use the short ribs to make the braised recipe.</p>
         <p>The full slab ribs are mostly found at the back of the cow. You can request directly from the <br>
         butcher or check into your local grocery store.</p> <br>
         <h2>Equipment for making BBQ Ribs</h2>
         <p>Gas grill with two or more burners / Oven - You need this for cooking the ribs</p>
         <p>Tongs - this is for turning the ribs sideways from time to time</p>
         <p>Oven thermometer - use this to check the doneness of the ribs</p>
         <p>Metal drip pan - You need this to collect the liquid from the meat while baking or grilling.</p>
         <p>Aluminum foil -  This keeps the beef moist and prevents it from drying out. It also <br>
         helps the seasoning to circulate deep into the ribs.</p>
         <p>Basting brush or mopping tool - You need the brush to apply the BBQ sauce.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>How to tell that your beef ribs are done?</h2>
        <p>It takes a long time for beef ribs to become tender. One of the signs of tenderness is that <br>
         the bone begins to fall off. You will know that the rib is done when the internal temperature <br>
         reaches 200°F. You can cook them a bit longer for them to be completely done.</p>
         <p>If you don't have a thermometer to measure the internal temperature, you can gently lift <br>
         the rib bone. When the rib falls off, the beef is done. If you want to try this, ensure that you  <br>
         use a kitchen towel to prevent. Another option is to use your tong to twist the center rib; <br>
          the ribs are ready if they fall out easily.</p>
          <p>You can also cut into the meat to see if it is done. If there is no pink, the meat is done <br>
         completely. Lastly, you can use a toothpick to check. The meat is done by inserting a <br>
          toothpick into the flesh and removing it easily. </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Place the ribs on a wide tray or a wooden slab, pull off the membrane, <br>
         and trim any excess fat.</p>
         <p>Rub the oil all over the ribs. Then mix all the rub ingredients in a small <br>
        bowl and season the ribs generously with the rub mix by pressing the rub  <br>
        firmly onto the ribs. Cover up with foil while you prepare the barbeque sauce.</p>
        <p>Mix all the barbeque sauce and brush generously over the front and back <br>
        of the ribs and leave to marinate for at least 3 hours in the refrigerator <br>
        (if you have the time). If you are short of time, you can cook immediately.</p> <br>
        <h2>Grill method:</h2>
        <p>Prepare the grill and heat to 275 degrees </p>
        <p>Place the meatier side of the ribs down on the grill over indirect heat. <br>
