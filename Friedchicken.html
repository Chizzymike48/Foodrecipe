     <h2>How Do I make A Flavorful Crispy Fried Chicken Legs?</h2>
     <p>This recipe uses whole milk and eggs as wet ingredients. However, you can use buttermilk in <br>
     place of whole milk if that's what you prefer.</p>
     <p>The dry ingredients are flour and spices and there's no need to marinate the chicken as <br> 
     long as you season your milk mixture with salt and black pepper. If you don't season it, <br>
     you will miss out on flavor. Trust me on this! </p>
     <p>If you follow these easy steps your fried chicken will turn out into an outer shell <br>
     that you love biting into, with a moist and tender interior so be sure not to <br>
     skip any step. </p>
        <p>For the best results, use a deep-fryer or a large heavy-bottomed pot to fry your chicken. <br>
        This will help maintain a consistent temperature and ensure even cooking. <br>
        Use a thermometer to monitor the oil temperature, keeping it between 350°F (175°C) <br>
        and 375°F (190°C) for optimal frying. Avoid overcrowding the pot, as this can lower the oil temperature <br>
        and result in greasy chicken. Fry the chicken in batches if necessary, allowing enough space for <br>
        each piece to cook evenly. </p>

        <h2>Crispy Fried Chicken Drumsticks</h2>

        <p>First, make a mixture of milk, eggs, salt, and black pepper. Set aside.</p>
        <p>Next, combine the flour with the spices. Mix well.</p>
        <p>Place the legs inside the dry ingredient mixture and coat well. <br> 
        Then transfer it to the milk mixture. Coat well.</p>
        <p>Finally, transfer the legs back to the bowl of dry ingredients and <br>
        coat well until the legs become thickly coated. At this point, the <br>
        chicken is ready to be fried.</p>
        <p>If you want the pieces extra crispy, redip in the egg-milk mixture and seasoned flour.</p>
        <p>Fry these battered chicken legs preheated oil in it. The oil in the pan must reach 350 <br>
         degrees for optimal crisping of the fried chicken batter. You'll turn the chicken over <br>
         partway through the frying process until the entire drumstick is crisp and browned—about <br>
         12 to 15 minutes.</p>
         <p>Be sure to place your fried chicken on a plate lined with paper towels to soak up the <br> 
        extra oil and allow your fried chicken rest for 1-2 minutes before serving.</p> <br>

        <p>An average chicken leg will take approximately 12 to 15 minutes when deep pan-frying, <br>
         but it's also advisable to check the chicken's internal temperature to ensure the <br>
         meat is cooked to 165 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
         <h2>Why is my fried chicken not crispy?</h2>
            <p>If your fried chicken isn't crispy, it could be due to several factors: <br>
            1. Oil Temperature: Ensure the oil is at the right temperature (350-375°F or 175-190°C) <br>
            before adding the chicken. If the oil is too cool, the chicken will absorb more oil and become greasy rather than crispy. <br>
            2. Overcrowding: Avoid overcrowding the pan, as this can lower the oil temperature and lead to soggy chicken. <br>
            Fry in batches if necessary. <br>
            3. Coating: Make sure the chicken is well-coated with a seasoned flour mixture. A thicker coating can help achieve a crispier texture. <br>
            4. Draining: After frying, place the chicken on a wire rack instead of paper towels to drain excess oil. This prevents the chicken from sitting in oil and becoming soggy. <br>
            5. Resting: Allow the chicken to rest for a few minutes after frying to let the coating set and become crispier. <br>
            6. Type of Flour: Using all-purpose flour is common, but mixing in some cornstarch can enhance crispiness. <br>
            7. Moisture: Pat the chicken dry before coating it to remove excess moisture, which can prevent the coating from adhering properly and becoming crispy.</p>

            <h2>NOTES:</h2>
            <p>I used peanut oil because of its high smoke point and...well....taste and I will advise you <br>
             to do the same or better still use oils like Grapeseed, Canola, Corn, Olive, Sesame seed <br>
             or Sunflower.</p>
                <p>Also, if you want to make this recipe healthier, you can bake the chicken in the oven at <br>
                400 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35-45 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches <br>
                165 degrees Fahrenheit. This method will still give you a crispy exterior while reducing the <br>
                amount of oil used.</p>
                <p>For an extra crispy coating, you can double-dip the chicken by repeating the egg-milk <br>
                and flour coating process before frying.</p>
                <p>Feel free to adjust the seasoning in the flour mixture to suit your taste preferences. <br>
                You can add more spices or herbs to enhance the flavor.</p> 
                <p>Make sure to monitor the oil temperature throughout the frying process to maintain a consistent <br>
                heat. This will help ensure that the chicken cooks evenly and achieves the desired crispiness.</p> <br>
