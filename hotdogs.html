    <h3>Hot Dog Buns</h3>
    <p>
        Have you ever had a craving for hot dogs but been left with lackluster store-bought buns?<br>
        Today, I'm sharing a game-changing recipe that will redefine your hot dog experience – <br> 
        Quick and Easy Hot Dog Buns.
    </p> <br><br>
    <h2>Flavor and Texture - simplicity without compromising on <br> taste</h2>
    <p>
        Flavor and texture are the major things that are really important to me when it comes to <br>
        bread. I know bread making can be a little time consuming, and I'm not a fan of bland <br> 
        bread that tastes like cardboard or bread with terrible hard textures. That is why I always <br>
        look for ways to create bread recipes in a much easier and more straightforward way <br>
         without sacrificing taste or texture.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        These buns are perfect for sandwiches and hot dogs and can be enjoyed as breakfast,<br> 
        lunch, or dinner, and they are great for BBQ Cookouts, Family reunions, tailgating, <br>
        Birthdays, Holidays, parties, and more! Unlike most store-bought buns, these buns have no <br> 
        high-fructose corn syrup and no artificial colors or flavors.

        <h2> Easy Hot Dog Buns Recipe</h2>
If you want to make a batch of hot dog buns as quickly as possible without sacrificing <br>
 results, this is the right recipe for you. <br>

In order to achieve a perfect result, I suggest you use bread flour because of its higher <br>
gluten content when compared to all-purpose flour. Bread flour will yield a high-rise bun <br>
that is soft and springy in texture. <br>

Although all-purpose flour produces great results on the first day, I must admit that I have <br>
a personal preference for the texture of buns made with bread flour on the second and <br>
third days. The difference is subtle but definitely noticeable in terms of overall satisfaction. <br>

    <h2>Step by step instructions to make tasty, soft, and fluffy Hot Dog Buns.</h2>
    <p>All you need is just six everyday ingredients and some simple instructions, and you will be <br>
    rewarded with a batch of freshly baked hot dog buns.
</p> <br>
<h3>Step 1: Proof the yeast</h3>
<p>If you don't have instant yeast, you can use an equal amount of active dry yeast. Just <br> 
   add it along with the other ingredients; there's no need to proof.</p>
   <h3>Step 2: Combine the dry ingredients, mix, and leave to rest</h3>
   <p>Leaving the dough to rest at this stage is very important. This will give the flour a bit of <br>
     time to absorb the liquid, and it makes the dough much easier to work with.</p>
     <h3>Step 3: Knead the dough and leave to rest a second time</h3>
     <p>Knead the dough for about 3 to 4 minutes. That's fine! Don't sweat it!! </p>
     <p>The dough will still be a little sticky at this point; don't be tempted to add more flour;<br>
        otherwise, the resulting buns will be dense.</p>
        <h3>Step 4: Shape the dough, rest the dough, and bake:</h3>
        <p>Cut the dough into eight pieces and shape into about 6 inches long. Brush with the egg <br>
         wash. Leave to rest for 15 more minutes and bake.</p>
