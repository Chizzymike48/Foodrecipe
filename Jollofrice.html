     favorite vegetables (diced carrots, green beans, sweet peas, or sweet corn). It can be enjoyed with chicken, beef, lamb meat,<br>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>The ingredients required for making jollof rice are pretty basic. You probably already have them in your kitchen.</p>
        <p>The main ingredient in jollof rice is, of course, rice. I used long-grain parboiled rice <br>
         for this recipe, but you can also use basmati. I have a recipe for that here - (basmati Jollof with beef).</p>
         <p>Next up are the canned tomato, fresh tomatoes, bell peppers, scotch bonnet, onions, <br> 
        garlic, and ginger—each of which adds a unique flavor and texture to your dish!</p>

        <p>Stock—Chicken, beef, or vegetable stock are great choices here for adding depth of <br>
         flavor.</p>
        <p>And lastly, there's the seasoning and herbs—curry powder, salt, black/white pepper, <br>
         bouillon powder, thyme, and bay leaves.</p>

        <h2>How To Cook Jollof Rice</h2>

         <p>When cooking Jellof rice, building a flavor base is very important. Don’t be in haste <br> 
        to dump your ingredients in the pot otherwise, you will end up with what we call a ”concoction. <br>
        ” Each step counts, so try to do each of the steps in detail.</p>
        <p>The inevitable foundation for building up the flavor in this meal is to start by sauteeing <br>
        the Onions. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes. The next thing is to stir in the tomato paste. <br>
        This adds a deep and rich tomato flavor; I simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabout.</p>
        <p>Add the ginger and garlic and cook along with the tomato paste for another two minutes; Actually, <br>
         by the time this is ready, you will notice it in the smell. If you keep it cooking any longer, <br> 
         you might risk burning them.</p>
         <p>Add the blended peppers. Usually, there is no particular time frame for frying this pepper. <br>
         I often stop when the sauce becomes really thick, and the oil literally floats on top of the sauce. <br> 
         At this point, most of the water is gone, and the sauce no longer smells raw. Trust me, you will know, <br>
         but just in case you are still in doubt, I would say maybe 15 to 20 minutes depending on the quantity <br>
         of water in your blended pepper.</p>
         <p>Finally, in building my flavor, I add the thyme, curry powder, salt, white pepper (good but optional), <br>
         and seasoning cubes. Adjust the seasoning at this point if there is a need to.</p>
         <p>Once the flavor is on point, then, I stir in the Rice. Make sure you stir the rice properly until you <br>
        cover each grain of rice with the sauce.</p>
        <p>Now add the chicken stock. Give it a brief stir and cover it up with a tight-fitting lid. If <br>
         your lid is not fitting enough, simply cover the rice with foil paper before covering it with <br>
         the lid. This is because Jollof needs a lot of steam in order to turn out well.</p>
         <p>Once the rice comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low immediately and <br>
         continue to cook until the rice is done, about 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
         <p>Serve with Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled Chicken, Grilled Tilapia Fish, or Gizzards and plantains.</p>

        <h2>Nigerian Jollof Rice or Ghanaian Jollof Rice?</h2>

        <h5>Who's Jollof rice is better?</h5>
        <p>I don’t even want to go into the issue of the trending Jollof wars, especially between <br>
        Nigeria and Ghana. All I know is that a good cook will make a good-tasting Jollof Rice. <br>
        In my own opinion, I think it has to do with the cooking abilities of an individual and <br>
        not a country. Let me know your opinion. </p>
        <h2>What type of rice is best for Jollof Rice?</h2>
        <p>Though quite a lot of rice types can be used to make Jollof rice. I have used the long grain <br>
        parboiled rice for this recipe - This rice is soaked, steamed, and dried. Then the hull is <br>
        removed to make parboiled rice. The steaming enables the rice to absorb nutrients and <br> 
        changes the starch so that it cooks into a firmer, less sticky dish of rice than regular <br>
        white rice. I also have a beef jollof rice recipe that I prepared using basmati rice. <br>
        You may want to check it out.</p>
        <p>If living in the united states, I will recommend using the parboiled rice from the <br>
        African store or Uncle Ben's parboiled rice (converted brand). It doesn’t stick or clump <br>
        up like most other rice brands. It cooks up grain for grain. Some stores like Walmart also <br>
        carry a similar brand for a fraction of the price.</p>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>First, make the tomato-based sauce by blending together the red bell <br>
             peppers (pimento), tomatoes, onion, and scotch bonnet.</p>
             <p>Heat the cooking oil in a large pan over medium heat, then add the diced <br>
            onions and let them cook for about 3 minutes or until they are soft.</p>
            <p>Next, add the tomato paste and fry for about 5 minutes. Then stir in garlic, <br>
             ginger, and bay leaves—leave to cook for 2 more minutes.</p>
             <p>Add the blended sauce and allow the pepper to cook until the water is <br>
             reduced and the sauce become thick —about 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
             <p>Season with thyme, curry powder, bouillon cubes, salt, and pepper to taste. <br>
            Cook for another 2 to 5 minutes.</p>
            <p>Add the rinsed rice to the sauce and stir until it is well coated with the <br>
            sauce. Then add the chicken stock, stir briefly, cover with a tight-fitting lid, <br>
             and bring to a quick boil over high heat.</p>
             <p>Once it begins to boil—after about 3 to 5 minutes, reduce the heat <br>
             immediately to low and steam until the rice is done—about 30 minutes.</p>
             <p>Add the butter, sliced tomato, and onions, stir together briefly and turn off <br>
             the heat. Cover it immediately so that the heat remaining in the rice can <br>
             steam up the vegetables a little.</p>
             <p>Serve with sweet fried plantains, roasted chicken, or salad</p>
