    <p>If you're following a keto diet but crave a sweet and satisfying breakfast or snack, look no further! <br>
     These Keto Almond Flour Blueberry Muffins are fluffy, moist, and filled with blueberry goodness.</p> 
     <p>Even if you are not on a keto diet, if you're simply looking for a delicious and healthy breakfast or snack option, <br>
     this Keto Almond Flour Blueberry Muffins Recipe is perfect for you.</p> 
     <p>This recipe uses simple ingredients like almond flour, flax meal, and monkfruit as the sweetener to ensure minimal carbs but maximum flavor. <br>
     The combination of almond flour and blueberries provides a burst of flavor, color, and vitamins, <br>
     making them keto-friendly. These muffins offer a nutty flavor and nutritional punch</p>
     <h2>The Difference In Flaxmeal</h2>
     <p>I suggest using the golden flax meal instead of the brown variation for your muffins. <br>
     Golden flaxseeds have a light, buttery, and slightly sweet taste, while brown flaxseeds have a bolder, <br>
     toasted flavor. Using dark brown flax meal will overpower the flavor of your muffins and give them an unusual color.</p>

        <h5>Dry ingredients</h5>
        <p>Almond flour - a nutrient-rich alternative to traditional flour with a nutty flavor and <br>
        texture.</p>
        <p>Golden Flax meal - binds the ingredients together and gives structure to the muffins. <br>

        <p>Salt - enhances the flavor of the muffins.</p>

        <p>Unsweetened plain whole milk yogurt - Opt for unsweetened plain whole milk <br> yogurt in your recipe. <br>
        This ingredient contributes significantly to the moisture and texture of the recipe, <br>

        as it won't provide sufficient moisture to the mixture <br>due to its thicker consistency compared to regular yogurt.</p>
        <p>Vanilla extract - adds a pleasant vanilla taste.</p>
        <p>Eggs - act as a binding agent, add moisture, and aid in leavening.</p> <br>
